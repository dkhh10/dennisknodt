# Welcome to my blog

Okay so this is my first personal website. Not owned by any of the big companies.

Or is it? Do I truly own this site?

It's hosted on github pages.

## Why I started this blog
Frankly mostly because people I admire have their own sites. 

And I thought it would be cool to see how this evolves over the years.

This has potential compounding effects.

And I like compounding.
## What you can expect
You can expect some dope posts.

Quote me on that!
